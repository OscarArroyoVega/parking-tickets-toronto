# parking-tickets-toronto

Processing Toronto's open data on the location, type, and $ of parking ticketes

To run, put the downloaded `.zip` files of parking tickets into a sub-folder called `data`


To do:
- take a year of tickets
- do a summary on infractions by type (count and $)

- join the tickets to the centre line file - linear geocoding
- want result to be something like this
Centreline ID, geom, etc | n_tickets_year_type | $_tickets_year_type

- for Pemb - would want an n by year? or a total n for 2010 to 2019 for example?
- would want overall n, and n for parking in loading zones (maybe just a segment map of high ticketted loading areas?)
