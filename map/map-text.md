# Mapping Parking Tickets in Toronto

Over 22.8 million parking tickets were issued in the City of Toronto in the decade spanning 2011 to 2020, representing over 1 billion dollars in fines. This map shows almost* all of these parking tickets.

Data on the locations of parking tickets are from the City of Toronto. We joined them to the City's centreline data representing streets in order to make this map. Both were available as open data.

The spatial distribution of parking tickets represents a combination of the supply and demand for curbside space and patterns of enforcement. 


*The data on parking tickets only indicate addresses, not XY coordinates. Some of the addresses (less than 5%) could not be linked to streets due missing numbers or incorrect spellings.
